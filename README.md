# Fast Game

A simple chrome extension that speeds up your YouTube vidoes.

## Installation

If you trust me enough that I am not injecting malware into your browser, you can try out this plugin in your own browser!

**Download plugin from the releases page**

Navigate to the [releases](https://github.com/Spyobird/fast-game-ext/releases) page (on the right sidebar). You can choose any release, but I would recommend the latest one. Download the file labelled `releases.zip` by clicking on it. When you have dowloaded the file, you can unarchive it to get the contents inside. You should see there is a folder labelled `dist`.

**Leading the Chrome extension**

Open up Google Chrome, and navigate to `Settings > Extensions > Manage Extensions`. This should bring you to the extensions page. There is a toggle switch labelled as `Developer mode`, ensure that it is enabled. You will notice that a few buttons emerge. Click on `Load unpacked` and subsequently select the `dist` folder that was previously extracted. You should then see the `fast game` extension loaded.
 
## Using the extension

Open up any video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com). Open up the `fast game` extension from the toolbar. Click on button to get zoomies. Win.
